🙋‍♂️ About Me

I'm a UI/UX Designer and Front-End Developer who builds complete, end-to-end digital experiences.

I specialize in bridging the gap between creative vision and functional code. My process starts in Figma, where I design intuitive, user-centered interfaces for everything from complex, multi-portal platforms (like SkillMedha) to engaging mobile apps (like TopicPrep).

I then bring those designs to life with clean, responsive HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. I've led the design and frontend development for e-commerce platforms, corporate websites, and administrative dashboards. I also have experience in data visualization, building interactive Power BI dashboards that help businesses make smarter decisions.
